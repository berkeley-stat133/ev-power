# Lab 4 Worksheet - Practice

* add something about loading a csv and having to use
# Split the one column into four
energy_raw <- separate(
  energy_raw,
  col = 1,
  into = c("State", "2021", "2022", "2023"),
  sep = ","
)
* make sure str extract is clear str_extract(.x, "\\d+\\.?\\d*")

#### Q1. Extract and clean text patterns from strings using regular expressions.

You are given a messy dataset of energy sources with inconsistent units and spacing.

```{r}
energy_sources <- c("Solar (MWh)", "Wind (GWh)", "Coal (MWh)", "Hydro (kWh)")
```

a.  Use str_detect() to identify all energy sources that contain the substring "Wind" or "Hydro" (hint: use the \| operator in regex).

```{r}

```

b.  Extract the unit type (e.g., MWh, GWh, kWh) using str_extract(). Make sure your pattern handles extra spaces or hyphens.

```{r}

```

c.  Clean the names to keep only the energy source name, trimming whitespace and removing parentheses.

```{r}

```

d.  Create a clean tibble called energy_clean with two columns: source and unit.

```{r}

```

e.  Discussion: Why might regex cleaning be important before performing joins or aggregations?\

#### Q2. State Datasets: Joins and Pivots

We’ll use built-in datasets to explore US state-level data. state.x77 contains metrics such as population, income, and life expectancy. state.region classifies each state into one of four regions: Northeast, South, North Central, West.

```{r}
# Load datasets
library(dplyr)

# Convert matrix to data frame
states <- data.frame(state.x77)

# Add state names as a new column
states$state <- rownames(states)

# select and reorder columns
states <- states |>
  select(state, Income, Population, Illiteracy)
# table for regions
regions <- data.frame(state = state.name, region = state.region)

states

```

a.  Perform a left join to combine socioeconomic and regional data.

```{r}

```

b.  Perform an inner join. How many rows remain, and why is it the same or different?

```{r}

```


c.  Perform an anti join to check if any state names don’t match between datasets. What might cause mismatches like this in real projects?

```{r}

```

d.  Discussion: Why would you prefer a left join over an inner join when merging state-level datasets?\
    \
e. Use pivot_longer() to make the socioeconomic data longer.\

```{r}

```

#### Q2.5.

Load this data:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

# Sample sales data
sales <- tibble(
  Store = c("Store A", "Store B", "Store C"),
  Jan_Sales = c(100, 150, 120),
  Feb_Sales = c(200, 180, 130),
  Mar_Sales = c(150, 200, 140)
)

sales
```

a. Convert the dataset from wide (one column per month) to long (one row per month per store).

```{r}

```

b. Clean month names by removing _Sales.

```{r}

```

c. Convert the long dataset back to wide, with one column per month.

```{r}

```

#### Q3. Mapping

Let's visualize data by state.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(maps)
library(dplyr)

us_map <- map_data("state")

state_data <- states |>
  left_join(regions, by = "state") |>
  mutate(state = tolower(state))

```

Use a join to combine the us_map with the state_data

```{r}
us_map_joined <- ...
```

Create a chloropleth map:

```{r}
ggplot(us_map_joined, aes(long, lat, group = group, fill = Income)) +
  geom_polygon(color = "white") +
  coord_fixed(1.3) +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_viridis_c() +
  labs(title = "Average Income by State")
```

b.  Swap Income for Life Exp to visualize life expectancy instead. Try changing the color scale using scale_fill_gradient() or scale_fill_gradient2()

```{r}

```

#### Q4. Quarto Dashboard Setup

Create a new file ev-dashboard.qmd and add:

```{markdown}

---
title: "EV Power Dashboard"
format: dashboard
---

Add some sections:

### Overview

Your project introduction.

### Map Visualization

# Paste your ggplot map code here

### Data Table

# Show your joined dataset

head(us_map_joined)

Then render:
